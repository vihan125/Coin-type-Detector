# Coin-type-Detector

## Task and assumptions

Coin type detector of a vending machine that accepts three types of coins as the payment. Rs. 1, Rs. 2 and Rs. 5 are the three types of coins. Three light sensors are used in combination to detect the type of the coin. Figure below shows how the light sensors (DX, DY and DZ) are positioned to identify the coins when the coins are rolling down the channel of the vending machine. 


## Implementation

### Capturing fingerprint image

As the first attempt optical flow sensor ADNS 3080 was used to capture the fingerprint image because it is very sensitive to movemnts and has a high resolution with small images.
ADNS 3080 module takes a image with 30x30 resolution.
